RAxML tree rooting algorithm


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-PTHREADS -f I -t RAxML_bipartitionsBranchLabels.txid40120 -m PROTGAMMAJTT -n txid40120_reroot 



Your input tree contains branch labels, these will also be printed in the output tree ...

RAxML-rooted tree using subtree length-balance printed to file:
/home1/modh01s/Projects/ICTV-phylo-master/pipeline/mptp/ViCTree_mptp/ViCTree/txid40120/RAxML_rootedTree.txid40120_reroot


Time for tree rooting: 0.012692
